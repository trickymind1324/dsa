Using Sorting
-------------
If 2 strings are anagrams, they must contain exactly same characters with same frequencies.

By sorting both the strings, all characters will be arranged in a consistent order. If the 2 sorted strings are identical then they are anagrams.

<<ALGO>>
- If length of the strings differ, return False immediately because they cannot because they can't be anagrams.
- Sort both the strings.
- Compare the sorted strings - if they are equal, return True. Otherwise return False.
- TIME COMPLEXITY : O(nlogn + mlogm), SPACE
COMPLEXITY : O(1) or O(n) -> depends on sorting algorithm used.

--------------
Using Hash Map
--------------
Instead of sorting, we can count how many times each character appears in both strings.
By using 2 hash maps(or dictionaries), we can track the frequencies of each character in both strings.
If both frequency maps match exactly, then they are anagrams.

<<ALGO>>
- If length of the strings differ, return False immediately because they cannot because they can't be anagrams.
- Create 2 hash maps, to store character frequencies of both strings.
- Iterate through both strings at same time:
	# Increase the character count for s[i] in the first hash map.
	# Increase the character count for t[i] in the second hash map.
- After building both maps, compare them - if both hash maps are equal, return True. Otherwise, return False.
- TIME COMPLEXITY : O(n + m), SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1), [since we have at most 26 different characters]

-----------------------------
Using Hash Table(Using Array)
-----------------------------
Since problem guarantees lowercase english letters, we can use a fixed-sized array of length 26 to count character frequencies instead of a hash map.

This approach is effcient because it avoids hashing and uses constant space.

<<ALGO>>
- If length of the strings differ, return False immediately because they cannot because they can't be anagrams.
- Create a frequency array of size 26, initialized to zero.
- Iterate through both strings:
	# Increment count at index corresponding to s[i].
	# Decrement count at index corresponding to t[i].
- After processing both strings, scan through count array:
	# If any value is not zero, return False because frequencies differ.
	# If all values are zero, return True since strings are anagrams.
- TIME COMPLEXITY : O(n + m), SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1), [since we have at most 26 different characters].
