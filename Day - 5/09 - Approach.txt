Using HashSet
-------------
- Convert the list into a set for O(1) lookups.
- Initialize 'longSeq' to track the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
- For each number num in set:
	* Check if num - 1 is not in the set:
		> If true, num is the start of a sequence.
		> Initialize currSeq = 0.
		> While num + currSeq exists in the set, increase currSeq.
- Update longSeq with the maximum length found.
- Return longSeq after scanning all numbers.
- TIME COMPLEXITY : O(n), SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(n)
