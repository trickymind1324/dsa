Using Two Pointers
------------------
- Initialize two pointers: l = 0, r = len(heights) - 1
- Set res = 0 to store the maximum area.
- While l < r:
	* compute the current area:
		> area = min(heights[l], heights[r]) * (r - l)
	* update res with the maximum area so far.
	* move the pointer at the shorter height:
		> if heights[l] <= heights[r], move l right.
		> otherwise, move r left.
- Return res after the pointers meet.
- TIME COMPLEXITY : O(n), SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)
